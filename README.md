# Kodtag.org

**Kodtag.org — a space for ideas, experiments, and digital presence.**

This repository hosts the source for **[Kodtag.org](https://kodtag.org)**.  
It starts as a simple site powered by GitHub Pages, but it is designed to evolve beyond a static presence.  
The vision is to build a living digital space where concepts, prototypes, and projects can take form.
